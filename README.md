# Bank Transaction EDA for Fraud Detection 🏦💳

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of bank transactions with the goal of identifying patterns and behaviors indicative of fraudulent activity. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, we uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies that can serve as the foundation for building predictive fraud detection models.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.

## 📊 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Standardized formats for key columns (e.g., dates, numerical values).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions of transaction amounts, timestamps, and other key features.
   - Examined correlations between features to identify predictors of fraud.
   - Analyzed class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created heatmaps, box plots, and scatterplots to uncover relationships.
   - Highlighted fraud trends and anomalies in transactional data.

## 📈 Key Insights
- High-value transactions have a stronger likelihood of being flagged as fraudulent.  
- Certain timeframes see a spike in fraudulent activity, suggesting periodic patterns.  
- Class imbalance between fraud and legitimate transactions is significant, making it essential for future modeling considerations.
